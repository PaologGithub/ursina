## Adding Documentation
Use docstrings sparingly.
Add test/examples at the bottom at the file.
Separate examples can be added in docs/ and will be automatically added by the documentation generator.
Write unit tests using ursinatest (_test)


How to update documentation

## API Reference
The API Reference is generated by docs/documentation_generator.py.
This script tries to extract information

To change what files it parses, change the `groups` dict in docs/documentation_generator.py

You can document functions by adding a comment after the declaration, like this:
```
def my_function():  # do something cool
    ...
```
Keep in mind, comments like this must add something, not simply repeat the function name.


## Updating Samples
Samples are also added by docs/documentation_generator.py, since it takes the source code from files in  samples/ and turns them into .sswg files.
Afer modifying a sample, to make it aslo update on the website, do:
1) `python docs/documentation_generator.py`
2) `python -m sswg`


## Website
The ursina website is made using sswg, a format similar to Markdown.
To update website content, edit the .sswg file, *not* the .html files.
To convert the .sswg file, run:
```
pyhton -m sswg
```
in the folder (docs/)
